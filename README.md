Captcha Verification (or Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a common web technique used to help ensure that your respondents are real humans and not a program written to spam your survey.

This is a Delphi implementation that you can use in your own projects. 

As allways it free and it's open source.
